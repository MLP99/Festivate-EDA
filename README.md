## Festivate: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
For this school project, my group members and I started a fictional company called Festivate to help fictional festival organizers to gain more insights from their data to help with decision making. In this project, I'm going to share my work. I designed the SQL database for this project for the festival organizers and used R to manipulate and visualize data.

* Designed a SQL database with 23 tables for the festival organizers
* Used SQL to write queries to gain insights about revenue, logistics, festivals and festival visitors
* Used also R for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to modify en visualize data to extract insights

## Goal:
The goal of this school project was to create a fact sheet that contains essential information that was discovered during multiple data analysis each group member did.

## Conclusion
During this project, I learned how to design a relational database model and how to query data to extract insights. In the database part of this project, I got to learn more about how to use common table expressions, how the different SQL joins work and how to use subqueries. While doing the Exploratory Data Analysis, I learned how to wrangle data with R and how to visualize data with the ggplot2 library to communicate my findings with other people.
